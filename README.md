# UrZone
Context based sharewall app created for final project at The Iron Yard

UrZone uses rssi to read proximity to iBeacons.  Within a certain range of a specific beacon, a unique sharewall will be triggered that allows the user to have a social experience whilst engaging in the world around them.
